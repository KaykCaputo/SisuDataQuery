# **SisuDataQuery**

### Allows querying data from the SISU API through a console application.

Currently you can check the weights and min grades of any course registered in the sisu.

## How it works:

Query the sisu api initially for institutions by state, then for courses by institution and finally for information on the specified course.

## How it works:

After installing the dependencies, simply run the code and enter the requested information when requested, firstly the institution's acronym and then the course code.
